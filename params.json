Overview\r\nIn a few (2-3) sentences explain what is going to be reported on.\r\n\r\n### 2. Simulations\r\nInclude English explanations of the simulations you ran, with the accompanying R code. Your explanations should make clear what the R code accomplishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```r\r\nn <- 100\r\nlambda <- 0.2\r\nexpSims <- NULL\r\nnsims <- 1000\r\nfor (i in 1:nsims){ \r\nexpSims <- rbind(expSims, rexp(n, 0.2))\r\n}\r\nmeansVec <- apply(expSims, 1, mean)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```r\r\nhist(meansVec, breaks = 20, main=\"Sample Mean versus Theoretical Mean\", xlab=\"\")\r\nabline(v=mean(meansVec), lwd=3, col=\"blue\", lty=2)\r\nabline(v=1/lambda, lwd=3, col=\"red\", lty=5)\r\nlegend(\"topright\", legend=c(\"Sample Mean\", \"Theoretical Mean\"), lty=c(2,5), \r\n       col=c(\"blue\", \"red\"), lwd=3, bty=\"n\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\r\n\r\n\r\n```r\r\nmen <- runif(10)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```r\r\nmen <- runif(10)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\r\n\r\n### 3. Sample Mean versus Theoretical Mean\r\nThe sample mean is equal to 4.99, while the theoretical mean, $1/\\lambda$, is equal to 5.\r\n\r\n![](course_project_1_files/figure-html/histoMeans-1.png) \r\n\r\n### 4. Sample Variance versus Theoretical Variance\r\nInclude figures (output from R) with titles. Highlight the variances you are comparing. Include text that explains your understanding of the differences of the variances.\r\n\r\n### 5. Distribution\r\nVia figures and text, explain how one can tell the distribution is approximately normal.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
